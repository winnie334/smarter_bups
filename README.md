# Smarter bups!

This repository is striving to be an "improved" version of [Smart bups](https://github.com/winnie334/smart_bups), a project showing how a genetic algorithm works.

## How to run
Download/clone the repo, and open **index.html**. Alternatively you can host a local server to run it on. It should work straight away.
If not, please report the bug so I can do absolutely nothing whatsoever to fix it.

## Found a bug?
Lol wow good job that probably wasn't too hard. Open up an issue and I might take a look at it. Of course I'm open to pull requests as well.

## Future plans
Although the previous repo "Smart bups" was based on a genetic algorithm, this repo might not be. Because the bups will be able to interact with each other a different approach might be needed. For example, using a neural network. However my experience with this kind of stuff is nonexistent so don't get your hopes up too high.
